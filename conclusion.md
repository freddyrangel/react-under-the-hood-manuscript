# Conclusion

Congratulations, you have reached the end of this book! At this point, you are well on your way to becoming an expert in React. Not only do you now understand the great majority of React's API, but you understand its philosophy and how it works under the hood. You now understand the Virtual DOM, reconciliation, event delegation, and autobinding. With this deeper understanding, you can better debug and optimize React applications. You are ready to take on large web applications with React.

Still, there is always more to learn in software development. Any discussion of React inevitably involves Flux. While we touched on it briefly, you should take the time to learn at least one Flux library. Then you can make better decisions about when to use Flux and when to either stick with vanilla React or create your own data handling solution. I recommend taking a look at [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as it seems to be the most popular Flux library at the moment.

Also worth looking into is the cutting edge of JavaScript: ES2015. There are many great features that are being introduced to the language. React is now moving heavily toward ES2015 so it is good to know for the future. Also, ES2015 classes help clean up your React components, making them easier to read and understand.
