React is now the prefered JavaScript library for building rich front-end web applications. Its popularity is fueled by its simple yet powerful API, friendliness toward existing applications, and incredible performance.

"React Under the Hood" goes over React fundamentals as well as its internals. By the time you finish reading the book, you should have a solid understading of React, how it works under the hood, and how to debug React applications. We will go over React patterns and anti-patterns, its overall architectural philosophy, and how to work with third-party libraries.

Best of all, we're not going to do yet another Todo app. Rather, this book walks you through how to build a simple Star Trek video game from scratch using React!
